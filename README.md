**Many thanks to them and all my [donors](#donations)üôèüèª** 

The Icom IC-7300 or IC-9700 transceivers do not have Bluetooth or WiFi support.

This project allows to set up an HTTP _proxy_ allowing to talk wirelessly, from an M5Stack (or other equipment), with an Icom transceiver like IC-7300 or IC-9700 and sending CI-V commands.

> I don't own the IC-9700, so I haven't tested it. But it seems to work well.

This project was made to work with my [ICMultiMeter](https://github.com/armel/ICMultiMeter) and [ICSMeter](https://github.com/armel/ICSMeter) on M5Stack.

# Technical architecture

ICUSBProxy only need Python3.

## Connexion

__M5Stack__ <--- (_WiFi Connection_) ---> __PC with ICUSBProxy__ <--- (_USB Connection_) ---> __Icom Transceiver__.

As a PC, I'm using a simple Raspberry Pi under Raspbian. But it could work with another PC and another operating system. 

## GET Request data format

`civ = {CI-V bytes field command},{baud},{tty}` 

Examples,

```
civ = fe,fe,a4,e0,00,56,34,12,07,00,fd,115200,/dev/ttyUSB0
civ = fe,fe,a4,e0,03,fd,115200,/dev/ttyACM0
```

# Installation

Check that you have Python3 on your PC. If not, install it.

Then, still on your PC or Mac, clone the ICUSBProxy project via the command :

`git clone https://github.com/armel/ICUSBProxy.git`

You can also download a [zip archive](https://github.com/armel/ICUSBProxy/releases) of the project, if you prefer, and unzip it.

# Usage

Plug your Transceiver via the USB cable to your PC. Ok, now it's time to start the Python3 script.


## Command line

To start the Python3 script, here the basic command :

`./ICUSBProxy.py`

By default, the HTTP port is 1234, but you can change it. For example, if you want to change it for 2345 :

`./ICUSBProxy.py 2345`

For Linux users, if you want to run this process even after logging out, here is the command :

`nohup ./ICUSBProxy.py 2345 &`

## Shell script (for Linux users)

If you prefer, I add a shell script too, with `stop`, `start` and `restart` action.

`./ICUSBProxy.sh start`

`./ICUSBProxy.sh stop`

`./ICUSBProxy.sh restart`

Edit line 4 to change default port (1234) if necessary.


# Improve (for Linux users)

The code of this proxy could probably be improved. But it has the advantage of being simple and light.

In use, I noticed some stability problems over time, probably due to a saturation of the streams exchanged by USB. In this case, you just have to restart the Proxy and everything goes back to normal.

Moreover, I get very good results, by restarting the Proxy automatically every hour, via the Crontab. I add this entry to my Crontab :

`0 * * * * /home/pi/ICUSBProxy/ICUSBProxy.sh restart` 

Change it to your needs. It depends on the path where you install ICUSCProxy...
